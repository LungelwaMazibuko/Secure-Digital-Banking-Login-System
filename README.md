# **Secure Digital Banking Login System with 2FA & Biometric Authentication**

This is a secure digital banking login system that emphasizes strong security practices. It includes **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** via SMS or authenticator app, **biometric authentication** (fingerprint/face ID) for mobile, **password encryption**, and **secure session management**. This system is designed to ensure the protection of sensitive user data, making it suitable for integration into financial applications.

---

## **Features**
- **User Registration**: Users can register with their email and password, with email verification to ensure valid accounts.
- **Secure Login**: Users log in with their email and password, followed by **2FA** (via SMS or an authenticator app like Google Authenticator).
- **Password Encryption**: Passwords are hashed using **bcrypt** before being stored in the database to ensure security.
- **Biometric Authentication (Mobile)**: Users can opt for **fingerprint** or **Face ID** login for quicker and more secure access (on mobile platforms).
- **Session Management**: The app uses **JWT tokens** to manage secure user sessions.

---

## **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend (Mobile App)**: React Native (cross-platform), Swift (iOS), Kotlin (Android)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js or Python (Django/Flask)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0, JWT, Google Authenticator (for 2FA)
- **2FA**: Twilio API (SMS) or Google Authenticator (app-based 2FA)
- **Encryption**: bcrypt (password hashing), AES (data encryption)
- **Biometric Authentication (Mobile)**: React Native Biometrics, native SDKs (Android/iOS)

## **Installation**

### **Backend Setup**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/secure-digital-banking-login.git
   cd secure-digital-banking-login
   ```

2. Install dependencies (Node.js example):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables (e.g., for Twilio, JWT secret):
   - Create a `.env` file and add necessary environment variables:
     ```
     TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
     TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
     JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
     DB_URI=your_database_connection_string
     ```

4. Run the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### **Frontend Setup (React Native)**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/secure-digital-banking-login-app.git
   cd secure-digital-banking-login-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. For Android or iOS, ensure you have the correct environment set up (React Native CLI, Android Studio, or Xcode for iOS).

4. Run the app on your device:
   - For Android:
     ```bash
     npx react-native run-android
     ```
   - For iOS:
     ```bash
     npx react-native run-ios
     ```

## **Key Features Implementation**

### **1. User Registration**
- When users register, their password is hashed using **bcrypt** before being stored in the database.
- An email verification link is sent to the user for account activation.

### **2. Secure Login**
- During login, users enter their email and password.
- The server checks the credentials against the hashed password in the database.
- If the credentials are correct, the system triggers **2FA**.

### **3. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
- **SMS-based 2FA**: Twilio API sends an OTP to the user's phone for verification.
- **App-based 2FA**: Users can use Google Authenticator to generate OTPs for login.

### **4. Biometric Authentication**
- On mobile devices, users can enable **fingerprint** or **Face ID** for easy login.
- The React Native app uses the **React Native Biometrics** package or platform-specific libraries for biometric login.

### **5. Password Encryption & Session Management**
- **bcrypt** is used to securely hash passwords before storing them.
- Upon successful login, a **JWT** token is generated, stored locally on the mobile app, and used to authenticate further API requests.

---

## **Security Best Practices**
- **Password Hashing**: Passwords are never stored as plain text. They are hashed using **bcrypt** to ensure that even in case of a data breach, the actual passwords are not exposed.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Even if someone obtains the password, they cannot access the account without the second authentication factor (OTP or authenticator app).
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data such as JWT tokens, user info, and session data are encrypted using **AES** before storage and during transmission (via HTTPS).
- **Biometric Security**: The app supports **fingerprint** and **Face ID** login, which adds an extra layer of security for mobile users.

---

## **Testing**
- **Unit Testing**: All components of the system, such as user registration, login, and 2FA, should be tested individually.
- **Integration Testing**: Test the flow of registration, login, and 2FA.
- **Security Testing**: Perform penetration testing to check for common security vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF.

---

## **Deployment**

### **Backend Deployment**
- Deploy the backend on platforms such as **AWS**, **Heroku**, or **DigitalOcean**.
- Ensure secure configurations for JWT token validation, Twilio credentials, and database connection settings.

### **Mobile App Deployment**
- Once the app is fully functional, deploy it to the **Google Play Store** (for Android) and/or **Apple App Store** (for iOS).
- Follow app store submission guidelines, including privacy policy and permissions for biometric authentication.

---

## **Future Enhancements**
- Add support for additional 2FA methods, such as email-based OTP or push notifications.
- Implement advanced encryption techniques for data storage and transmission.
- Integrate multi-device login support, allowing users to log in on multiple devices while maintaining security.
