### **Project Plan for Building a Secure Digital Banking Login System with 2FA & Biometric Authentication Using Kotlin (Solo Developer)**

---

### **Project Overview**
The goal of this project is to develop a **Secure Digital Banking Login System** using **Kotlin** for Android that includes **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**, **biometric authentication (fingerprint/face ID)**, **password encryption**, and **secure session management**. The app will ensure high security for user data and will simulate key features seen in banking apps.

---

### **Duration**: 10-12 weeks (Adjustable based on availability and progress)

### **Tech Stack**:
- **Frontend (Mobile App)**: Kotlin (Android Studio)
- **Backend (optional for full-stack app)**: Node.js or Python (Flask/Django) (If building a backend)
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication (for 2FA), Google Authenticator, or Twilio for SMS-based OTP
- **Biometric Authentication**: Android Biometric API for Fingerprint and Face ID
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore (or SQLite for local storage)
- **Security**: bcrypt (password hashing), AES (data encryption), HTTPS

- **Objective**:
  - If a backend is included, set up a simple backend (Node.js or Python) with Firebase or your chosen authentication service.
  - Implement **Firebase Authentication** for secure login and **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**.
  - Enable **SMS-based OTP** via Firebase or **Google Authenticator** for app-based OTP.
  
- **Deliverables**:
  - **Authentication API**: Functional authentication system with email/password login, 2FA, and JWT (for secure sessions).
  - **2FA Service**: Integrated SMS/Email OTP or Google Authenticator.
  - **Secure Password Storage**: Use bcrypt or Firebase’s secure password storage.

---

#### **Phase 4: Frontend (Mobile App) Development**
- **Duration**: 3-4 Weeks
- **Objective**:
  - Build the **mobile app** using **Kotlin** in **Android Studio**.
  - Implement the following screens:
    - **Welcome Screen**: First screen showing app logo and options to log in or register.
    - **Registration Screen**: User creates an account with email and password.
    - **Login Screen**: Login form with email and password fields.
    - **2FA Screen**: Input field for the OTP sent via SMS or Google Authenticator.
    - **Biometric Authentication Screen**: Fingerprint/Face ID authentication.
    - **Home Screen**: Display user account overview after successful login.
    - **Settings Screen**: Allow users to update email, password, enable/disable 2FA, and biometric options.
  - Integrate **Biometric Authentication** using Android's Biometric API (Fingerprint/Face ID).
  - Handle authentication flow and error messages (e.g., invalid credentials, 2FA failure).

- **Deliverables**:
  - **Mobile App**: Fully functional Android app with all necessary screens and features.
  - **Biometric Authentication**: Integrated fingerprint and Face ID features.
  - **2FA Integration**: OTP authentication via SMS/Google Authenticator.
  - **Secure Login**: Implement secure password hashing and encryption.

#### **Phase 5: Security Enhancements**
- **Duration**: 1 Week
- **Objective**:
  - Implement **password encryption** using bcrypt or similar libraries to ensure stored passwords are secure.
  - Ensure **secure communication** between the mobile app and backend using HTTPS.
  - Encrypt sensitive user data (like personal info and transactions) with AES encryption.
  - Verify security features like **session management**, ensuring users are logged out after inactivity or on logout.

- **Deliverables**:
  - **Encrypted Password Storage**: Secure storage of user passwords using bcrypt.
  - **HTTPS Communication**: Secure connections for app-to-server communication.
  - **Data Encryption**: Encryption of sensitive data like account info.

---

#### **Phase 6: Testing & Debugging**
- **Duration**: 2 Weeks
- **Objective**:
  - **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests for core app functionality (login, registration, 2FA, biometric authentication).
  - **UI Testing**: Test for usability and ensure the UI is intuitive and easy to navigate.
  - **Security Testing**: Perform basic security testing like SQL injection prevention, password cracking, etc.
  - **Error Handling**: Ensure the app handles errors gracefully (e.g., wrong credentials, network failures).
  
- **Deliverables**:
  - **Test Results**: Reports from unit testing, UI testing, and security testing.
  - **Debugged App**: Bug-free mobile app ready for deployment.
