For creating a prototype of your **Secure Digital Banking Login System with 2FA & Biometric Authentication**, you can use the following tools:

### **Software Tools for Prototyping**
1. **Figma**: A popular design tool that allows you to create interactive prototypes with ease. It's perfect for collaborative design and sharing with team members.
2. **Adobe XD**: Great for both design and prototyping with interactive elements. It also supports team collaboration.
3. **Sketch**: Another tool for designing interactive prototypes, particularly for macOS users.
4. **InVision**: Specializes in prototyping and allows for user testing and feedback.
5. **Marvel**: A simple, easy-to-use prototyping tool that integrates well with other design systems.
6. **Balsamiq**: Good for low-fidelity wireframes and simple prototypes.
7. **Axure RP**: A more advanced tool that lets you create highly interactive and dynamic prototypes.

### **How to Create the Prototype**
- Start by designing **low-fidelity wireframes** for each screen using one of the tools above.
- Once wireframes are ready, move on to **high-fidelity mockups** with the actual branding and design elements.
- Use **interactive features** (like buttons, transitions, and input forms) to simulate the flow of user actions (e.g., logging in, 2FA verification, etc.).
- Test the prototype by sharing it with others for **feedback** and iterating on the design based on their insights.

This prototype will help visualize the app’s user experience and user interface before actual development begins.
